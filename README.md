# Python---Cleaning-and-Transforming-Bank-Marketing-Data

## Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and transforming data from a bank's marketing campaign. The data was collected to help the bank understand the effectiveness of their marketing efforts in attracting customers to take out personal loans. The data contains various columns such as client information, campaign statistics, and economic indicators.

The goal is to clean, reformat, and split the data into three separate CSV files so the bank can store and use them for future campaigns in a PostgreSQL database.

## Data Overview

The raw data, `bank_marketing.csv`, contains information on clients, previous marketing campaigns, and economic indicators. The task is to clean and preprocess the data into three CSV files based on the specified structure:

1. **client.csv** - Contains client demographic data:
   - `client_id` (integer)
   - `age` (integer)
   - `job` (string)
   - `marital` (string)
   - `education` (string)
   - `credit_default` (boolean)
   - `mortgage` (boolean)

2. **campaign.csv** - Contains campaign-specific data:
   - `client_id` (integer)
   - `number_contacts` (integer)
   - `contact_duration` (integer)
   - `previous_campaign_contacts` (integer)
   - `previous_outcome` (boolean)
   - `campaign_outcome` (boolean)
   - `last_contact_date` (datetime)

3. **economics.csv** - Contains economic indicators:
   - `client_id` (integer)
   - `cons_price_idx` (float)
   - `euribor_three_months` (float)

## Cleaning Requirements

- Replace any periods (`.`) with underscores (`_`) in job and education columns.
- Convert `unknown` values in the education column to NaN.
- Convert categorical columns like `credit_default`, `mortgage`, and `campaign_outcome` to boolean values (`1` for "yes", `0` for "no").
- Convert the `previous_outcome` column to boolean values (`1` for "success", `0` for others).
- Create a `last_contact_date` column from the `year`, `month`, and `day` columns.
- Output the cleaned data into three CSV files: `client.csv`, `campaign.csv`, and `economics.csv`.

## Code
First of all, we need to import both `pandas` and `numpy`, as we'll need both libraries.
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```
#### Reading the data
```python
df = pd.read_csv("bank_marketing.csv")
```
The script starts by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame named `df`.
#### Cleaning the job and education Columns
```python
for column in ["job", "education"]:
    df[column] = df[column].str.replace(".", "_")
```
The script loops through the `job` and `education` columns, replacing any period (`.`) characters with an underscore (`_`). This standardizes the text values in these columns.
#### Handling Missing Data in the education Column
```python
df["education"] = df["education"].replace("unknown", np.nan) 
```
The value "unknown" in the `education` column is replaced with `NaN`, which is a common way to represent missing or undefined data.
#### Converting Categorical Columns to Boolean
```python
for column in ["credit_default", "mortgage", "campaign_outcome"]:
    replace = {
        "yes": 1, "no": 0, "unknown": 0
    }
    df[column] = df[column].map(replace).astype(bool)
```
The `credit_default`, `mortgage`, and `campaign_outcome` columns are transformed to boolean values:
- "yes" becomes 1
- "no" becomes 0
- "unknown" becomes 0
The `astype(bool)` method ensures that the columns are explicitly converted to boolean data types.
#### Converting previous_outcome to Boolean
```python
to_replace = {
    "success": 1, "nonexistent": 0, "failure": 0
}
df["previous_outcome"] = df["previous_outcome"].map(to_replace).astype(bool)
```
The `previous_outcome` column is similarly transformed:
- "success" becomes 1
- "nonexistent" becomes 0
- "failure" becomes 0
This conversion also ensures the column has a boolean type.
#### Creating the last_contact_date Column
```python
df["year"] = "2022"
parts = df["year"] + "-" + df["month"] + "-" + df["day"].astype(str)
df["last_contact_date"] = pd.to_datetime(parts, format="%Y-%b-%d")
```
The script creates a new column called `last_contact_date` by combining the `year` (2022), `month`, and `day` columns. These are then combined into a string and converted to a datetime object using `pd.to_datetime()`, ensuring the proper date format is used.
#### Defining New DataFrames
```python
client = df[["client_id", "age", "job", "marital", "education", "credit_default", "mortgage"]]
campaign = df[["client_id", "number_contacts", "contact_duration", "previous_campaign_contacts", "previous_outcome", "campaign_outcome", "last_contact_date"]]
economics = df[["client_id", "cons_price_idx", "euribor_three_months"]]
```
After cleaning the data, the script splits the DataFrame into three smaller DataFrames:
- `client`: Contains client-specific information such as ID, age, job, marital status, education, and financial status (credit_default, mortgage).
- `campaign`: Contains campaign-specific information like number of contacts, duration, previous campaign interactions, and outcome.
- `economics`: Contains economic indicators like the consumer price index and Euribor rates.
#### Saving Cleaned DataFrames to CSV
```python
dataframes = [client, campaign, economics]
filenames = ["client.csv", "campaign.csv", "economics.csv"]
for df, filename in zip(dataframes, filenames):
    df.to_csv(filename, index=False)
```
Finally, the three cleaned DataFrames are saved as CSV files (`client.csv`, `campaign.csv`, and `economics.csv`). The index=False argument ensures that the DataFrame index is not included in the saved file.

## Conclusion
This script demonstrates effective data cleaning and transformation techniques using Python and the pandas library. Here's an overview of the skills and tools used in this project:

String Manipulation: Replacing characters such as periods and handling missing values (e.g., replacing "unknown" with NaN).
Categorical Data Transformation: Converting categorical values (e.g., "yes", "no", "unknown") into boolean values for easier analysis.
Date Handling: Combining year, month, and day columns to create a proper datetime column for analysis.
DataFrame Structuring: Organizing the cleaned data into separate DataFrames for easier use and understanding.
File Output: Saving the cleaned data into separate CSV files for further analysis or integration into other systems.
By using these techniques, weâ€™ve prepared the data for further processing, analysis, or integration into more complex databases or analytics systems. This project highlights essential data wrangling skills that are critical in transforming raw data into a structured and usable format.
